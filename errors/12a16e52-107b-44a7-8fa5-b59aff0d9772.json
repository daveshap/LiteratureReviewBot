Examples of such\\nspaces appear everywhere in topology and geometry. The study of stratified\\nspaces involves invariants such as intersection cohomology which are only\\ninvariants under stratification-preserving homotopies. In this thesis, we study\\nthe homotopy theory of stratified spaces with respect to those stratified\\nhomotopies. To do so, we construct model categories for stratified spaces and\\nwe introduce new invariants to characterize them, the filtered homotopy groups.\\nA stratified space can be seen as a topological space $X$ together with a\\ncontinuous map to a poset of strata $X\\\\to P$. We begin our study by restricting\\nourselves to the filtered case, where the poset of strata is fixed. We define\\nthe model category of filtered simplicial sets, show that it admits a\\ndescription \\\"\\\\`a la Kan\\\", and characterize its weak-equivalences using the\\nfiltered homotopy groups. We deduce a proof of a filtered version of Whitehead\\ntheorem. We then construct a model category of filtered spaces. Its\\nweak-equivalences are the morphisms that induce isomorphisms on all filtered\\nhomotopy groups, and its fibrations satisfy a filtered version of Serre's\\nlifting conditions. We show that it is Quillen-equivalent to a category of\\ndiagrams of simplicial sets. We then work toward a comparison between the model\\ncategories of filtered simplicial sets and of filtered spaces. They are\\nconnected by a Quillen-adjunction, similar to the classical Kan-Quillen\\nadjunction. We conjecture that it is in fact a Quillen equivalence. Lastly,\\nworking with the notion of Quillen bifibration, we show that there are model\\ncategories of stratified spaces and of stratified simplicial sets.

Interestingly, opposite spins are locked to their respective\\nsub-band in each K valley of the TMD valence band with substantially large\\nenergy splitting, which enables polarized spins to be accessible through\\nelectrical gating and spatially separated by electric field through the valley\\nHall effect (VHE). Therefore, spatial separation and accumulation of spins in\\nthese 2D TMDs are uniquely referred to as coupled valley and spin Hall effect.\\nHere, we report an experiment of electrical generation of spin current with out\\nof plane polarization in monolayer WSe2 and detection of spin signals through a\\nnonlocal spin valve structure built on a lateral graphene spin diffusion\\nchannel that partially overlaps with WSe2.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Sun, 4 Aug 2019 20:32:00 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2019-08-06\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Hung\",\"Terry Y.

Two technologies of interest are Posit and RISC-V. Posit was\\nintroduced in mid-2017 as a viable alternative to IEEE 754-2008. Posit promises\\nmore accuracy, higher dynamic range, and fewer unused states along with simpler\\nhardware designs as compared to IEEE 754-2008. RISC-V, on the other hand,\\nprovides a commercial-grade open-source ISA. It is not only elegant and simple\\nbut also highly extensible and customizable, thereby facilitating novel\\nmicro-architectural research and exploration. In this paper, we bring these two\\ntechnologies together and propose the first Posit Enabled RISC-V core. The\\npaper provides insights on how the current 'F' extension and the custom op-code\\nspace of RISC-V can be leveraged/modified to support Posit arithmetic. We also\\npresent implementation details of a parameterized and feature-complete Posit\\nFPU which is integrated with the RISC-V compliant SHAKTI C-class core either as\\nan execution unit or as an accelerator. To fully leverage the potential of\\nPosit, we further enhance our Posit FPU, with minimal overheads, to support two\\ndifferent exponent sizes (with posit-size being 32-bits).

Existing approaches fail to explicitly model the mental\\nimagery function of the agent, while the mental imagery is crucial to embodied\\ncognition, and has a close relation to many high-level meta-skills such as\\ngeneralization and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel Mental\\nImagery eNhanceD (MIND) module for the embodied agent, as well as a relevant\\ndeep reinforcement framework for training. The MIND module can not only model\\nthe dynamics of the environment (e.g. 'what might happen if the agent passes\\nthrough a door') but also help the agent to create a better understanding of\\nthe environment (e.g. 'The refrigerator is usually in the kitchen'). Such\\nknowledge makes the agent a faster and better learner in locating a feasible\\npolicy with only a few trails. Furthermore, the MIND module can generate mental\\nimages that are treated as short-term subgoals by our proposed deep\\nreinforcement framework. These mental images facilitate policy learning since\\nshort-term subgoals are easy to achieve and reusable. This yields better\\nplanning efficiency than other algorithms that learn a policy directly from\\nprimitive actions. Finally, the mental images visualize the agent's intentions\\nin a way that human can understand, and this endows our agent's actions with\\nmore interpretability. The experimental results and further analysis prove that\\nthe agent with the MIND module is superior to its counterparts not only in EQA\\nperformance but in many other aspects such as route planning, behavioral\\ninterpretation, and the ability to generalize from a few examples.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 06:17:03 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2019-08-06\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Li\",\"Juncheng\",\"\"],[\"Tang\",\"Siliang\",\"\"],[\"Wu\",\"Fei\",\"\"],[\"Zhuang\",\"Yueting\",\"\"]]}",

Moreover, no phase transition toward delocalization is\\nexpected in 1D. This behavior is strongly modified in the presence of a bias\\nforce. We experimentally study this case, launching a non-interacting 39 K\\nBose-Einstein condensate in a 1D disordered potential induced by a\\nfar-off-resonance laser speckle, while controlling a bias force. In agreement\\nwith theoretical predictions, we observe a transition between algebraic\\nlocalization and delocalization as a function of our control parameter that is\\nthe relative strength of the disorder against the bias force. We also\\ndemonstrate that the initial velocity of the wave-packet only plays a role\\nthrough an effective disorder strength due to the correlation of the disorder.\\nAdding a bias force is a quite natural way to probe the transport properties of\\nquantum systems, a subject of broad interest that can be in particular\\naddressed with atomic quantum gases thanks to their high degree of control and\\nversatility [1]. For example, Bloch oscillations has been measured through the\\naddition of a constant force to atoms in periodic potential induced by an\\noptical lattice [2]. A force applied to a harmonic trap is equivalent to a trap\\ndisplacement. The response to such a displacement permits to reveal the fluid\\nor insulating behavior of atomic systems. In 1D interacting Bose gases, the\\npinning transition by an optical lattice [3] or the insulating transition in\\nquasi-disordered optical lattice [4, 5] have been studied in this manner. More\\nrecently, transport in quantum gases is also studied in junction-type setup\\nmore analogous to condensed-matter systems: two reservoirs with different\\nchemical potentials are connected through a constriction. For example, in a gas\\nof fermions, the quantization of conductance through a quantum point contact\\n[6] and the superfluid to normal transition in a disordered thin film have been\\nobserved [7]. In our work, we focus on the transport of non-interacting\\nparticles in disordered media. Without a bias force, quantum interferences\\nbetween multiple paths lead to Anderson localization [8] whose signature is an\\nexponential decay in space of single particle wave-function [9]. This\\nphenomenon is ubiquitous in wave/quantum physics and it has been observed in\\nmany physical contexts [10] including condensed-matter [11] and ultra-cold\\natoms [12-14]. One-dimensional truly disordered systems are always localized\\n[15], contrary to the 3D case where a phase transition between localized and\\nextended single particle wave-functions takes place as a function of the\\ndisorder strength [16-18]. The localization properties of 1D disordered systems\\nare modified in the presence of a bias force. Theoretical studies predict a\\ntransition from algebraic localization to delocalization as a function of a\\nsingle control non-dimensional parameter $\\\\alpha$ which is the ratio of the\\nforce to the disorder strength [19, 20]. Physically, $\\\\alpha$ is the relative\\nenergy gain $\\\\Delta$E/E of a particle of energy E when moving over a\\nlocalization length. Interestingly, in a 1D white noise disorder, this quantity\\nis independent of E as the localization length is proportional to E. If\\n$\\\\alpha$ is small, the force does not considerably change the localization\\nbehavior of the particle while for large $\\\\alpha$ its dynamics is severely\\naffected leading to delocalization. This localization-delocalization transition\\nis predicted in the infinite time limit for white noise disorder [20]. In a\\ncorrelated disorder, as the one produced from a far-off-resonance laser speckle\\n[21], the situation is more complicated. Speckles have no Fourier component\\nbeyond a spatial frequency 2k c. As a consequence, back-scattering and\\nlocalization are not expected in the framework of Born approximation for atoms\\nwith wavevectors k > k c [12, 22]. Since localized wave-functions always have a\\nsmall fraction at long distance corresponding to large energies and momenta in\\nthe presence of a bias force, we thus expect correlation-induced delocalization\\nat infinite time. However, signatures of the algebraic\\nlocalization-delocalization transition are predicted to be observable at\\ntransient times [20]. In this paper, we report on the observation of the\\nalgebraic localization-delocalization transition with cold-atoms propagating in\\na one dimensional disordered potential in the presence of a controlled bias\\nforce. We experimentally show that the non-dimensional parameter $\\\\alpha$ is\\nthe only relevant parameter to describe the transition. We notice that the\\ninitial velocity of the quantum wave packet only plays a role through the\\ncorrelation of the disordered potential, showing that the transition is\\nin-trinsically energy independent.

In particular we consider two different regimes for the neurons\\nwhich lead to two classes of excitability: class I, where the frequency-current\\ncurve is continuous and class II, where the frequency-current curve is\\ndiscontinuous.\\n  By applying ordinal analysis to sequences of inter-spike-intervals (ISIs) our\\ngoals are (1) to investigate if different neuron types can generate spike\\nsequences which have similar symbolic properties;\\n  (2) to get deeper understanding on the effects that electrical (diffusive)\\nand excitatory chemical (i.e., excitatory synapse) couplings have; and (3) to\\ncompare, when a small--amplitude periodic signal is applied to one of the\\nneurons, how the signal features (amplitude and frequency) are encoded and\\ntransmitted in the generated ISI sequences for both class I and class II type\\nneurons and electrical or chemical couplings. We find that depending on the\\nfrequency, specific combinations of neuron/class and coupling-type allow a more\\neffective encoding, or a more effective transmission of the signal.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 10:23:40 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2020-02-19\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Estarellas\",\"Cristian\",\"\"],[\"Masoliver\",\"Maria\",\"\"],[\"Masoller\",\"Cristina\",\"\"],[\"Mirasso\",\"Claudio\",\"\"]]}",

The few published over-the-air adversarial\\nexamples fall into one of three categories: they are either handcrafted\\nexamples, they are so conspicuous that human listeners can easily recognize the\\ntarget transcription once they are alerted to its content, or they require\\nprecise information about the room where the attack takes place, and are hence\\nnot transferable to other rooms. In this paper, we demonstrate the first\\nalgorithm that produces generic adversarial examples, which remain robust in an\\nover-the-air attack that is not adapted to the specific environment.

Considerably more topological\\ninformation is contained in the homology of the random field, as it completely\\ndescribes the creation, merging and disappearance of topological features in\\nsuperlevel set filtrations.\\n  In the present study we extend the topological analysis of the superlevel set\\nfiltrations of two-dimensional Gaussian random fields by analysing the\\nstatistical properties of the Betti numbers - counting the number of connected\\ncomponents and loops - and the persistence diagrams - describing the creation\\nand mergers of homological features. Using the link between homology and the\\ncritical points of a function - as illustrated by the Morse-Smale complex - we\\nderive a one-parameter fitting formula for the expectation value of the Betti\\nnumbers and forward this formalism to the persistent diagrams. We, moreover,\\nnumerically demonstrate the sensitivity of the Betti numbers and persistence\\ndiagrams to the presence of non-Gaussianities.\\n\",\"versions\":[{\"version\":\"v1\",\"created\":\"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 13:47:43 GMT\"}],\"update_date\":\"2019-10-02\",\"authors_parsed\":[[\"Feldbrugge\",\"Job\",\"\"],[\"van Engelen\",\"Matti\",\"\"],[\"van de Weygaert\",\"Rien\",\"\"],[\"Pranav\",\"Pratyush\",\"\"],[\"Vegter\",\"Gert\",\"\"]]}",

Spectroscopy\\nenables measurement of dust properties, such as flux, temperature and covering\\nfactor, with higher precision than photometry. In particular, it enables\\nmeasurement of both luminosity-based dust radii and dust response times. Here\\nwe report results from a one-year campaign on NGC 5548. The hot dust responds\\nto changes in the irradiating flux with a lag time of ~70 light-days, similar\\nto what was previously found in photometric reverberation campaigns. The mean\\nand rms spectra are similar, implying that the same dust component dominates\\nboth the emission and the variations. The dust lag time is consistent with the\\nluminosity-based dust radius only if we assume a wavelength-independent dust\\nemissivity-law, i.e. a blackbody, which is appropriate for grains of large\\nsizes (of a few microns). For such grains the dust temperature is ~1450 K.\\nTherefore, silicate grains have most likely evaporated and carbon is the main\\nchemical component. But the hot dust is not close to its sublimation\\ntemperature, contrary to popular belief. This is further supported by our\\nobservation of temperature variations largely consistent with a heating/cooling\\nprocess. Therefore, the inner dust-free region is enlarged and the dusty torus\\nrather a \\\"dusty wall\\\", whose inner radius is expected to be\\nluminosity-invariant. The dust-destruction mechanism that enlarges the\\ndust-free region seems to partly affect also the dusty region.
